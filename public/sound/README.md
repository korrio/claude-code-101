I'll expand the healing melody to include the complete "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" song with both verses. This is a traditional children's song that's in the public domain.Perfect! I've updated the healing melody to include the complete traditional song with all verses. Here's what's new:

ðŸŽµ **Complete Melody Structure:**
- **First verse**: "Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are"
- **Second verse**: "Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky" 
- **Final verse**: Repeats the opening verse for a satisfying conclusion
- **Total duration**: About 22 seconds of beautiful, calming melody

ðŸŽ¶ **Enhanced Features:**
- **Rest notes**: Added silent pauses between verses for better phrasing
- **Proper timing**: Each verse flows naturally with appropriate spacing
- **Visual feedback**: Wave animation now matches the full melody duration
- **Gentle volume**: Slightly reduced volume (0.08) for a more soothing experience
- **Extended final note**: The last note holds longer for a proper ending

The complete melody now provides a much more satisfying and meditative experience, perfect for the spiritual sound healing theme. When you click "Play Healing Melody," you'll hear the full traditional song that many find deeply calming and nostalgic. The gentle triangle wave tones create a pure, healing sound that complements the sacred frequencies beautifully.
